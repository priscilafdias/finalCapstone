#What this code do?
This code will change an initial sentence using the Caesar Cypher through a key with the difference of 15 letters between them, having their special characters preserved. It`s a very good technique to "hide" messages.
If you open the code, you can see how it works and I will help you to understand it.
Let's go?
Follow the steps :)
* in the line 3 I have determined my key with the numbers of the letters that I will change;
* in line 4, the message that will be changed was declared;
* between lines 7 and 10 I have declared all the alphabet in lower and upper case;
* between lines 12 and 27 the magic happens, using a conditional statment (if, elif and else) I asked for the machine looked all the code and start to substitute the letters, but preserving the special characters;
* in line 30 will print the original message;
* in line 31, the cypher message.

#Instalation:
For a quick view, you can open this code right here on GitHub, but if you want to run it, you may need to have a program like Visual Code installed on your computer.
